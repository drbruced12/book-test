O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) v2.0

This document serves as the overall framework for the set of
specialized E2SMs, each of which is dedicated to a specific RAN
function. This document also includes the common information elements
used across the specialized E2SMs.

O-RAN E2 Service Model: RAN Control (E2SM-RC) v1.0

This document specifies the capabilities exposed over E2 interface to
enable efficient control of RAN, including radio bear control, radio
access control, connected mode mobility, etc. The following services
are detailed in the specification:

* E2 REPORT services, which are used to expose RAN control and UE
  context related information

* E2 INSERT services, which are used to suspend RAN control related
  call processes

* E2 CONTROL services, which are used to resume or initiate RAN
  control related call processes, modify RAN configuration and/or E2
  service-related UE context information

* E2 POLICY services, which are used to modify the behaviour of RAN
  control related processes

O-RAN E2 Service Model: Key Performance Measurement (E2SM-KPM) v2.0

This document specifies the capabilities exposed over E2 interface to
enable report of measurements from O-DU, O-CU-CP, and/or O-CU-UP. This
version supports the necessary performance measurements to fulfill the
requirements for Traffic Steering and QoS/QoE optimization use cases.

Service Model for RAN Control (RC)

In its initial form the E2SM-RC specification had five key ingredients:

* The Insert Service: Defines how can the RAN “request” the RIC to
  control a given RAN functionality on a per-UE level/bearer-level?

* The Control Service: Defines how the RIC can “control” the RAN for a
   given RAN functionality on a per-UE level/bearer-level?

* The Report Service: Defines how the RAN can “report” state and context
   information to the RIC on a per-UE level/bearer-level (in addition to
   cell-level and node-level)?

* The Policy Service: Defines how the RIC can “prescriptively control”
   the RAN for a given RAN functionality on a per-UE level/bearer-level?

* The Event Trigger: Describes how to define the “events” in the RAN
  and how the RIC may subscribe to such events in order to execute the
  above services.

All these services are meant to control the following functionalities
in the first release:

* Radio Bearer Control
* Radio Resource Allocation Control
* Connected Mode Mobility Control
* Radio Access Control
* Carrier Aggregation Control
* Idle Mode Mobility Control (predominantly for traffic steering and QoS/QoE use-cases)

The E2SM-RC drafting team was comprised of four companies due to the
massive effort of the standard. The E2SM-RC drafting specification
(including the parts drafted by other companies) was primarily based
on Mavenir’s “parameter and message encoding contribution” that was
adopted in the specification. This allows the RIC to control any
parameter in the RAN in any level of hierarchical nested 3GPP
structures using a “generic encoding scheme,” instead of having to
enumerate individual message structures containing individual
parameters and categorizing them all as M or O or C-, as done in 3GPP.

Mavenir’s proposal categorized every RAN parameter as either an
ELEMENT (a singular RAN parameter) or a STRUCTURE (further containing
a sequence of RAN parameters) or a LIST (containing a list of itemized
structures) and the message between the RAN and the RIC can encode any
parameter based on this categorization, while using a simple structure
(again, defined by Mavenir). Mavenir also identified which RAN
parameters would need to be controlled by the RIC for the above
functions.
